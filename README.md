Welcome to your Tiger Pajamas Web Site!

To run locally:

To use the cool custom dividers, put one of the following in your markdown:
```
<hr class="divider-1" />
<hr class="divider-2" />
<hr class="divider-3" />
<hr class="divider-4" />
```

`chickadee.md` contains examples of the custom dividers, as well as buttons:
```
<a href="#" class="solid-button">Solid Button</a>
<a href="#" class="outline-button">Outline Button</a>
```

A content note: the nav currently has 3 tags with pretty long names to test out how big we can make it, and it works but looks a little awkward.  You are in control of which tags end up in the nav (max 3) so keep number and size of tag name in mind when designing your nav.
