The American Robin (*Turdus migratorius*) is one of the most recognizable songbirds in North America, and here in Vermont, its arrival is eagerly anticipated as a sign of spring's return.

## Characteristics and Behavior

* Distinctive orange-red breast
* Gray-brown back and head
* White eye arcs and throat
* Length: 9-11 inches
* Wingspan: 12-16 inches

> "The robin's song is a series of clear, whistled phrases that sound like 'cheerily, cheer up, cheer up, cheerily, cheer up.' It's one of the first bird songs we hear in the morning during spring and summer." - Vermont Birding Society

## Habitat and Diet

Robins are versatile birds that thrive in various environments:

* Lawns and gardens
* Woodlands
* Parks
* Farmlands

Their diet consists primarily of:

* Earthworms
* Insects
* Berries

## Nesting Habits

The female typically lays 3-5 blue eggs, which hatch after about two weeks of incubation.
